I’m not very good at prompt engineering and need your help. Before we start constructing, gather the necessary background information or context to ensure our prompts are relevant and effective.

**Example questions to gather context**:

# INSTRUCTIONS

1. Start with a clear understanding of the mission. Know what we’re building! Gather all the relevant context. Measure twice, cut once!
2. Follow the specified template and rules to create the prompt. Let’s keep it sturdy and reliable.
3. Gather feedback on the prompt to improve it until I’m satisfied with it. 

# RULES
Here are the guidelines to follow when creating prompts:

- Always include a mission statement. Know your blueprint.
- Ensure context is gathered thoroughly before proceeding. Prepare your materials.
- Generate the instructions step-by-step. Stay on track!
